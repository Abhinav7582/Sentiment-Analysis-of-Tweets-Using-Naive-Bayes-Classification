Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining or emotion AI) is the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. 
Sentiment analysis is widely applied to voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine. With the rise of deep language models, such as RoBERTa, also more difficult data domains can be analyzed, e.g., news texts where authors typically express their opinion/sentiment less explicitly.
Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral. Sentiment analysis is often performed on textual data to help businesses monitor brand and product sentiment in customer feedback, and understand customer needs.
machine learning allows computers to learn new tasks without being expressly programmed to perform them. Sentiment analysis models can be trained to read beyond mere definitions, to understand things like, context, sarcasm, and misapplied words.

Naive Bayes is a fairly simple group of probabilistic algorithms that, for sentiment analysis classification, assigns a probability that a given word or phrase should be considered positive or negative.
Essentially, this is how Bayesâ€™ theorem works. The probability of A, if B is true, is equal to the probability of B, if A is true, times the probability of A being true, divided by the probability of B being true.
Naive Bayes calculates words against each other. So, with machine learning models trained for word polarity, we can calculate the likelihood that a word, phrase, or text is positive or negative.
